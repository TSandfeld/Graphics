            One significant problem of projection shadows is that it is missing self-shadowing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shadow mapping on the other hand has self-shadowing. Shadow maps can also use depth to calculate 
            the shadows as opposed to projection shadows, which calculate based on a "flat" world assumption. 
            Two of the most common problems with shadow maps is shadow acne and aliasing.
